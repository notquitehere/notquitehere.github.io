Acording to [Skates.com](https://www.skates.com/pages/how-often-should-you-sharpen-your-ice-skates) ice skates need sharpening around every 20-30 hours of ice time (depending on the ice and the skater this can vary between extremes of 10 and 40). This sounds about right, though usually mine get done when I realise I don't have enough grip any more. Hence this idea.

## Things it needs to track:

- when you last sharpened your skates
- how many hours <strong>ice time</strong> you average between sharpening


## Optional extras:

Depending on how nerdy the user wants to get, what kind of ice they're skating on, or even what they're doing when skating as this might have an impact.
