This is not a new or unique idea. But it is a very cool one. Maybe I'll do it one day. Maybe [@thinkl33t](https://thinkl33t.co.uk/) will get there first.

## Thoughts

Two use cases:

- Remote chess game
- Playing chess against an AI

Implementation:

- moving the prices - magnets would make this more accessible than a robot arm (though that would be cool[^1]) it would also mean that the players could pick either colour.
- because the pieces would need to be slid there also needs to be a clear way to signify which piece is being selected - LEDs?
- have all the pieces be the same colour and signify who’s are who’s using LEDs?
- touch sensor in the piece for selection purposes?
