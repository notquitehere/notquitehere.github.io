This is a sneak preview of the 3D printed LED "eyes" I'm making for the giant BUG!

We'll have the giant BUG! on display and normal sized ones available to make at both [Liverpool MakeFest](https://lpoolmakefest.wordpress.com/) (27th June) and [Manchester MakeFest](http://www.mosi.org.uk/whats-on/makefest.aspx) (8th/9th August). This is the BUG! itself at a very early stage of construction:

I assembled the normal sized BUG! to the same point for comparison purposes.
