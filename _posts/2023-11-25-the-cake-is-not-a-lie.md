When asked what kind of cake he'd like for his birthday my husband responded with this

I think I did OK. While this cake is not a lie, it IS lying, from the outside it looks like a dark chocolate cake but when you cut it open it reveals itself to be... a plain sponge cake. Until you start eating and realise that it's actually a white chocolate cake.
