We were sent some "quick maths" squares as part of our KS1 remote learning package from school and 5yo LOVES them so I
whipped up a quick generator to make some more in different sizes.

Please note that I have set no maximums or minimums on this so you can if you want attempt to generate a square with
1000 rows or -10 columns. The former will work (providing you let it have more numbers than rows) and the latter will
give you a single column with "undefined" as the numbers in it. Here's a [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/N0tQuiteHere/myz1er89/149/) if you want
to play with it.

## To print

These are generated as images using the free html to jpg API from [GrabzIt](https://grabz.it/). This makes them a bit
slow to load compared to a pure JavaScript implementation as I put on jsfiddle, however it does make them easily
printable. If you want to print them just right click > open in new tab and print as usual.
